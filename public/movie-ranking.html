    <h3>Game of Thrones</h3> 
        <p>
            I love this series more than any other, because of the beautiful on-loctaion filming, as well as the costume design and great storyline.
        </p>
    <h3>The Tudors</h3>
        <p>
            This series is also one of my favorites because of the historical depiction of Henry VIII, and the story of his 6 wives.
        </p>
    <h3>The White Princess
        </br>The White Queen
        </br>The Spanish Princess
    </h3> 
    <p>These 3 series are tied together. It starts with the historical events of the 'War of the Roses' in the Brithish empire, and ends with Henry VIII's reign with his first wife Catherine.</p>
